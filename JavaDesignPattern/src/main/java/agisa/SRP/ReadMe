Srp  - Sting Responsibility Service

Idea is the make sure class handles only one task

User ==> Create a user objec where user has name , email and address

Store  == > Store class has ability to create storage by using hashmap to save user

UserValidator ==> Making sure the users are legit , has name , email and addressses according to config

UserPersistanceService == > Instanciate Store class , and saves the users

UserController ==> Handles incoming json request to work on user


Libraries are used : jackson for data-binding
                     Regex for pattern matching
                     Hashmap for saving users
                     synchronized : making sure to sync
